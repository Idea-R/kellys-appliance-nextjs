Kelly's Appliance Repair provides expert oven repair services for both residential and commercial clients, ensuring your cooking appliance functions efficiently and safely. Our team of experienced technicians is well-versed in handling various oven brands and models, from traditional gas and electric ovens to modern convection and smart ovens.



## Comprehensive Diagnostic Process


We begin with a thorough diagnostic assessment to accurately identify the issue. Common problems we address include:



Temperature Inconsistencies: We check and calibrate thermostats, heating elements, and sensors to ensure your oven heats evenly and maintains the correct temperature.
Electrical Issues: Faulty wiring, blown fuses, or malfunctioning control boards are inspected and repaired to restore proper operation.
Ignition Problems: For gas ovens, we troubleshoot and fix issues with the igniter, gas valve, or pilot light to ensure safe and reliable ignition.
Door Malfunctions: We repair or replace faulty door seals, hinges, and springs to ensure the oven door closes properly and retains heat effectively.
Control Panel Issues: We diagnose and repair unresponsive or malfunctioning control panels, buttons, and display screens to ensure ease of use.
