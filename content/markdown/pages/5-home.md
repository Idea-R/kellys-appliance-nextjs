## From Our Customers…

      EXCELLENT     Based on 109 reviews                         Robert Smith  2025-02-08   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. 7 month nightmare with Whirlpool on a warranty claim including multiple visits from their warranty technicians and nothing but run around. Then they sent Dane from Kelly’s Appliance out and 30 minutes later it was fixed!!!! Polite, courteous, knowledgeable and informative they are without reservation the best!              Pamela Williams  2025-02-06   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Dane and Porter were timely, wore booties, worked efficiently and cleaned up.  Dane also gave us important information about detergents.  Thanks guys!              Justin Hegarty  2025-02-03   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Extremely efficient service will definitely use again . James was professional and is a highly skilled technician and very pleasant to deal with. Abbey was also a pleasure to deal with. An excellent service.              Sylvia Wake-Hood  2025-01-24   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Shane came out to fix our KitchenAid dishwasher. It would start but not complete a cycle.
He came in the promised time window,
quickly diagnosed (faulty drain pump) and fixed (removed glass fragment) the dishwasher.
We are very happy.              Porter Anthony  2025-01-23   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. The best place in Sonoma & Marin County to have your appliances serviced & maintained.  I live in Petaluma. Ask any Petaluman (especially all the Realtors) who to call for repairs & they will tell you; Kelly’s.

I was at a catered event the other night sitting at a round table. A woman shared a story about how thrilled she was with Kelly’s because the service technician was able to repair the control board by desauldering & replacing a burnt out relay. Any other company would have said the board needs to be replaced & would have ordered a new one.  The problem with that is the board is discontinued.  They haven’t made parts for that wall oven for 20 years. Any other company and she would have had to replace her oven with a new one. Her oven is really old and it’s an odd size. She would have had to pay a cabinet maker to fit a lesser quality, more expensive, wifi connected, computer board centric, cheaper/thinner metal walled monstrosity & it would have cost a fortune for the privilege.  If kellys wasn’t trusted by Petalumans, they wouldn’t be in turning 50 this year.              John Ybarra  2025-01-16   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Excellent service and very respectful technician. Extremely happy and I have had several technicians who cannot measure up!              Jim C  2025-01-16   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Prompt, friendly and reliable! Contacted Kelly’s Appliance to look at our fridge. From the extremely friendly, Abby, who answered my call, to the moment Shane showed up and diagnosed the problem quickly, Kelly’s Appliances was extremely professional, courteous and knowledgeable. Shane ordered the replacement part and was back a few days later to install it. Working great! I will be highly recommending Shane and Kelly’s Appliance to people I know. Thank you Shane !              Nancy Monterosso  2025-01-16   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Kellys Appliance Repair is wonderful.
The staff and the technicians are friendly, supportive knowledgeable.
I always prefer using a family run business this company checks all the boxes              S C  2025-01-15   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. They were fantastic. They communicated so extremely efficiently I had multiple people helping me and adjusting timeframes to match my needs. They came right on schedule and fixed things quickly. budget friendly too! :)              Frances Nelson  2025-01-11   Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Kelly's recently sent Shane to diagnose a problem we have with our Maytag washer. Shane is knowledgeable, professional and easy to communicate with. Unfortunately, the Maytag was not repairable for a reasonable fee. He took the time to speak with use about different brands and gave us some ideas on a new washer. We recently purchased a new washer and are thrilled with it's performance. Recently, we noticed when the washer was filling with water, the pipes would make a very loud noise. He suggested we switch out the hoses, we did and now it works perfectly. Thank you Shane!  We will continue to use Kelly's and hopefully Shane for any appliance problems. The office staff is efficient and very pleasant. It is refreshing to find a company that is customer oriented. Thank you!
