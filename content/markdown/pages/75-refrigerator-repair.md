## Diagnostic and Repair Process


When you contact Kelly's Appliance Repair for refrigerator service, our technicians start with a thorough diagnostic assessment to identify the root cause of the problem. Common issues we address include:



Temperature Fluctuations: Inconsistent cooling can lead to spoiled food and higher energy bills. Our technicians check and repair thermostats, compressors, and other components to restore optimal cooling.
Leaks and Water Damage: Water leaks can result from faulty door seals, clogged defrost drains, or damaged water lines. We inspect and fix these issues to prevent further damage.
Unusual Noises: Strange sounds often indicate problems with the fan, motor, or compressor. We diagnose and resolve these noises to ensure quiet operation.
Ice Maker Malfunctions: Whether your ice maker is not producing ice or the ice quality is poor, we troubleshoot and repair the system to ensure consistent ice production.
