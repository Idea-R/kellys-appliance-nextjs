## Appliance Repair Pricing


We charge a service call fee to go to your location and diagnose the problem with your appliance. The technician will explain the reason for the needed repair, he will quote you a flat, fixed price taken right out of the Major Appliance Service National Price Guide and he will tell you if he thinks it's worth repairing or not. If you decide to go ahead with the repair the entire service call fee will be applied towards the labor on the repair.

## 90 Day Money Back Guarantee


If we fix your appliance and it breaks down again during the 90 day period following our repair, we will return for free to determine the problem. If the machine is not worth spending any additional money on, we'll give you back the original repair cost, less the regular service charge.
