Appliance repair scams can cost you time, money, and peace of mind. Fortunately, with a little knowledge and awareness, you can protect yourself from unscrupulous repair services. Here are some practical tips to ensure you hire a trustworthy professional and avoid falling victim to scams.



### 1. Verify Credentials


Always check if the repair service is licensed, insured, and certified to work on your appliance brand. Factory-authorized repair services are often your safest choice, as they have been vetted by the manufacturer and use genuine parts.



### 2. Do Your Research


Before hiring, read online reviews and ask for recommendations from friends or family. Look for repair companies with consistent positive feedback and a strong local reputation. Be cautious of companies with limited information or no online presence.



### 3. Request a Written Estimate


Legitimate repair companies will provide a clear, itemized estimate before starting any work. If a technician refuses to give you an estimate or pressures you to agree without seeing the costs, consider it a red flag.



### 4. Avoid Upfront Payments


Be wary of repair services that demand full payment upfront. Reputable companies usually charge after completing the job or may request a small deposit, especially for ordering parts.



### 5. Watch Out for "Too Good to Be True" Deals


While everyone loves a bargain, unusually low prices can be a sign of substandard service or an outright scam. Balance affordability with professionalism and reliability when making your choice.



### 6. Be Wary of Door-to-Door Technicians


Unsolicited offers for appliance repair, especially from door-to-door technicians, can often be scams. Stick with trusted local companies you've researched or been referred to.



### 7. Trust Your Instincts


If something feels off—whether it's vague answers to questions, unprofessional behavior, or high-pressure tactics—don't hesitate to walk away. Trustworthy companies value transparency and professionalism.



### 8. Use Trusted Resources


Leverage resources like the Better Business Bureau (BBB), Yelp, Diamond Certified or manufacturer websites to find reliable repair services in your area. These sources often list approved technicians and customer reviews to help guide your decision.



### 9. Ask About Warranties


A reliable repair company stands by its work. Ask if they offer warranties on parts and labor to ensure peace of mind after the job is done.



### 10. Document Everything


Keep records of all communication, estimates, receipts, and warranties. This documentation can protect you in case of disputes or issues down the line.


By following these tips, you can safeguard yourself against appliance repair scams and ensure your appliances are in good hands. When in doubt, rely on factory-authorized repair services like those offered by Kelly's Appliance to ensure professional, high-quality repairs every time!
