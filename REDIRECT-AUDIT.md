## Known Issues

### None Currently

All redirects are working as intended. Every WordPress URL redirects to the correct Next.js page.

## Missing Redirects? (Potential Additions)

If there were old WordPress URLs we're missing, check:

1. **Google Search Console** → Coverage → Excluded → "Redirect error"
2. **Server logs** → Look for 404s on old URL patterns
3. **Google Analytics** → Behavior → Site Content → "404 errors"

Common patterns that might need redirects:
- `/category/*` → `/blog` or `/services`
- `/tag/*` → `/blog`
- `/author/*` → `/about-us/our-team`
- Old service URLs like `/repairs/*` or `/fix/*`

---

## SEO Impact

**Timeline for Google to Update:**
- ✅ Redirects live: Immediate
- 🕐 Google crawl: 24-48 hours
- 🕐 Search results update: 1-2 weeks  
- 🕐 Full link equity transfer: 4-6 weeks

**Monitor in Google Search Console:**
1. Coverage → Excluded → Check for "Redirect" status
2. URL Inspection → Test old URLs
3. Sitemaps → Submit new sitemap.xml

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All redirects confirmed working
2. ✅ All destination pages exist
3. ⏳ Monitor Google Search Console for crawl errors
4. ⏳ Update any external links to use new URLs (optional but recommended)
5. ⏳ Check analytics after 1 week to verify redirect traffic

---

## Performance Note

Cloudflare suggests moving specific redirects above wildcard rules for better performance. This is **optional** - all redirects work correctly now.

**Current order:**
```
Wildcard first → Specific redirects
```

**Suggested order (faster):**
```
Specific redirects → Wildcard last
```

Savings: ~5-10ms per redirect (minimal but technically better)
